## Before creating a branch

Pay attention, it is very important to know if your modification to this repository is a release (breaking changes), a feature (functionalities) or a patch(to fix bugs). With that information, create your branch name like this:

- `release/<branch-name>`
- `feature/<branch-name>`
- `patch/<branch-name>`
